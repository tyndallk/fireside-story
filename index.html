        <p> It was a dark and stormy night and four men approached my car. 
            <br> Startled, I screamed hoping someone would hear me. <br>
        Luckily, someone did: my dog, Sam. Not to be confused with my boyfriend of the same name. <br>
        Sam - I'll let you guess which one - was upset because the scream hurt his ears.
